                <p>
                    Because of how easily Covid can spread, patients need to be isolated from people that do not have the virus to stop the spread. Our solution should make good use of the limited housing that is available and keep Covid patients away from healthy students/staff.

                    We created a Google JamBoard to help visualize a solution to our proposed problem. We have listen five main catagories to focus efforts on.
