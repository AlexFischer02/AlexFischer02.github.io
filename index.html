                    <p>
                        Because of how easily Covid can spread, patients need to be isolated from people that do not have the virus to stop the spread. Our solution should make good use of the limited housing that is available and keep Covid patients away from healthy students/staff.

                        We created a Google JamBoard to help visualize a solution to our proposed problem. We have listen five main catagories to focus efforts on.

                        These are sketches of possible solutions to the Covid-19 problem that my team and I came up with. The three to the left are the best three that we designed. If you click an image or the header, the PDF of all of our ideas will open. My three personal sketches are labeled with my name at the top.
